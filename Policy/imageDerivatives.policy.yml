description: |
  Drupal core's Image module allows for the on-demand generation of image
  derivatives. This capability can be abused by requesting a large number
  of new derivatives which can fill up the server disk space, and which
  can cause a very high CPU load. Either of these effects may lead to the
  site becoming unavailable or unresponsive.
remediation: Delete the variable `image_allow_insecure_derivatives`.
success: Image derivative security is enabled
failure: Image derivative security is not enabled.
