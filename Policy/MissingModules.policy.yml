description: |
  The warning was introduced in Drupal 7.50 and is displayed when Drupal is
  attempting to find a module or theme in the file system, but either cannot
  find it or does not find it in the expected place.
remediation: |
  Put the modules back in the codebase.
  *Warning* - many modules do important cleanup tasks during the uninstall
  process, and this solution will result in that being skipped.
  If at all possible, restore the missing module and uninstall it using the
  regular uninstall process.
success: No missing modules.
failure: |
  Missing modules were found:

    {{# messages}}
      - {{ . }}
    {{/messages}}
